            <h2>How the Process Works</h2>
            <p>Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the middleman service works:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Player Bets:</strong> Both players place their bets through the middleman platform, which integrates Stripe for secure payments. Stripe ensures that the money is held securely and that both players' funds are processed correctly.</li>
                <li><strong>Middleman Collects Bets:</strong> The middleman collects the bets and confirms that both players have made their deposits. Once both bets are confirmed, the game begins.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Begins:</strong> The middleman doesn't interfere with the game. Once the game starts, the middleman holds the players' money safely. This guarantees that neither player can withdraw their bet during the game.</li>
                <li><strong>End of Game:</strong> When the game ends, the middleman determines the winner based on the game’s outcome.</li>
                <li><strong>Money Transfer:</strong> After the winner is determined, the middleman releases the money to the winning player. Stripe is used to securely transfer the funds to the winner’s account.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <!-- Security and Trust Section -->

            <h2>Security and Trust</h2>
            <p>Our system ensures that players' funds are always safe and secure. By using Stripe, we are able to provide a trusted and reliable payment gateway that handles the financial transactions with the highest level of security.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secure Payment Processing:</strong> Stripe uses industry-leading encryption and security measures to protect your payment information.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Players can see their bets and the progress of their game, ensuring full transparency throughout the process.</li>
                <li><strong>Immediate Payout:</strong> Once the winner is determined, the payout process is quick and efficient, ensuring the winner gets their funds without delay.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Summary Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>By using Stripe as our payment processor, the middleman ensures that both players’ money is securely handled before, during, and after the game. This system removes any potential conflict, guaranteeing that players’ funds are safely managed and that the winner is paid promptly at the end of the game.</p>
