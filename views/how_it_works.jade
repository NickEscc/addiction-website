        p Here&apos;s a step-by-step breakdown of how the middleman service works:
        ol
          li
            strong Player Bets:
            |  Both players place their bets through the middleman platform, which integrates Stripe for secure payments. Stripe ensures that the money is held securely and that both players&apos; funds are processed correctly.
          li
            strong Middleman Collects Bets:
            |  The middleman collects the bets and confirms that both players have made their deposits. Once both bets are confirmed, the game begins.
          li
            strong Game Begins:
            |  The middleman doesn&apos;t interfere with the game. Once the game starts, the middleman holds the players&apos; money safely. This guarantees that neither player can withdraw their bet during the game.
          li
            strong End of Game:
            |  When the game ends, the middleman determines the winner based on the game&rsquo;s outcome.
          li
            strong Money Transfer:
            |  After the winner is determined, the middleman releases the money to the winning player. Stripe is used to securely transfer the funds to the winner&rsquo;s account.

        ul
          li

            |  Players can see their bets and the progress of their game, ensuring full transparency throughout the process.
          li
            strong Immediate Payout:
